The tracker settings are defined in a TrackerSettings class. The settings are described below.


Pupil tracker specific:

    int MAX_NOF_CLUSTERS;
        Maximum number of clusters

    int MAX_CLUSTER_SIZE;
        Maximum cluster size

    int MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE;
        Minimum number of clusters

    int MAX_PUPIL_RADIUS;
        Maximum pupil radius

    int MIN_PUPIL_RADIUS;
        Minimum pupil radius

    int NOF_RAYS;
        Number of rays casted within [-45, 45] degrees to the left and to the right in double ellipse fitting.

    int MIN_NOF_RADIUSES;
        Minimum number of found points in casting the rays.

    int MIN_PUPIL_AREA;
        Minimum pupil area computed by cv::contourArea()

    unsigned int NOF_VERIFICATION_FRAMES;
        The size of
        previous_ellipses. Used in coherence estimation. Get the best
        pupil candidate from the clusters.  An ellipse fit with the
        smallest error does not necessarily mean that this ellipse is
        best in terms of being similar to the previous
        results. Therefore, the ellipse with the smallest error will
        be chosen only, if the best ellipse, with respect to previous
        frames, was not found. However, the major axis of the ellipse
        with the smallest error will be stored as a part of a measure
        of goodness in frames to come.  This method was first
        introduced by Arto MerilÃ¤inen in his Master's Thesis.

    unsigned int MAX_NOF_BAD_FRAMES;
        Used in determing the coherence
        of a pupil ellipse candidate. The major axis is compared to N
        previous major axes and if out of N MAX_NOF_BAD_FRAMES are not
        good the candidate is not coherent. The comparison is done
        followingly: abs(curMaj - maj_i) > imgW / 120.0 if this
        condition is true, the it's bad.

    double ROI_MULTIPLIER;
        The ROI is a square area whose side is the
        previous frame's pupil's major axis multiplied with this
        value and the center is the starburst pupil centre.

    int ROI_W_DEFAULT;
        Default ROI width if an estimate was not found for it

    int ROI_H_DEFAULT;
        Default ROI height if an estimate was not found for it

    int MIN_ROI_W;
        If the pupil's major axis multiplied with ROI_MULTIPLIER is lower than this value, this values is used instead.

    int MAX_FAILED_TRACKS_BEFORE_RESET;
        The PupilTracker will reset starburst after this many failed pupil extractions 

    int CR_THRESHOLD;
        Threshold for the glints in the histogram equalised image

    int PUPIL_THRESHOLD;
        Threshold for the pupil in the histogram equalised image, if auto thresholding is off.

    int AUTO_THRESHOLD; // 0 or 1
        Auto threshold on 1, or off 0

    double CR_MAX_ERR_MULTIPLIER;
        A value between [0, 1] describing how good the CR candidates must be with respect to the best CR candidate.
         CR_MAX_ERR_MULTIPLIER *  curErr < errOfBest
         => maxAcceptedErr = errOfBest / CR_MAX_ERR_MULTIPLIER

    int CROP_AREA_X;
        Crop area x

    int CROP_AREA_Y;
        Crop area y

    int CROP_AREA_W;
        Crop area width

    int CROP_AREA_H;
        Crop area height



    Starburst specific

    int STARBURST_MAX_ITERATIONS;
        starburst_pupil_contour_detection() iterates with different starting points and measures convergence. The iteration ends when convergence is reached or this many iterations have passed.

    int STARBURST_REQUIRED_ACCURACY;
        Convergence accuracy

    int STARBURST_CIRCULAR_STEPS;
        Number of rays casted in starburst_pupil_contour_detection()

    int STARBURST_MIN_SEED_POINTS;
        At least this many seed points need to be found

    int STARBURST_BLOCK_COUNT;
        Into how many blocks the analysis is divided. A block means a ROI of the frame,

    double STARBURST_OUTLIER_DISTANCE;
        Each point's distance to the mean is tested and those whose distance is greater than
        the standard deviation * STARBURST_OUTLIER_DISTANCE are discarded.

    double STARBURST_RELATIVE_MAX_POINT_VARIANCE;
       Something quite magical happens with this. See for yourself in starburst.cpp



    CRTemplate specific

    int MAX_CR_WIDTH;
        The diameter of the corneal reflection template

    int CR_MASK_LEN;
        The Corneal reflection template image width



    GazeTracker specific

    double rd;
        The pupil's distance from the cornea sphere

    int NOF_PERIMETER_POINTS;
        Number of perimeter points to be ray traced.

    double MYY;
        The ratio of refractive coefficients of the air and the cornea



    Cornea Computer specific

    double RHO;
        Cornea sphere radius



    Gaze mapper specific

    double GAZE_DISTANCE;
       The distance of the gaze
